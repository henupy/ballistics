"""
Ballistic simulation for some kind of a rocket or missile or some shit. Takes into
account the changing atmospheric properties as a function of altitude, and the Earth's
curvature is also taken into account (or will be). The projectile can have some thrust,
which can also be time-dependent. Plan is to take into account also the changing mass
of the projectile (assuming that it loses mass while producing thrust).
